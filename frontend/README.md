# DALLE Cartoon Generator - Front End

This directory contains the front end for the **DALLE Cartoon Generator Project** at [traintocode.com/projects/cartoon-generator](https://traintocode.com/projects/cartoon-generator/).  The front end is build with [https://vitejs.dev/](https://vitejs.dev/) using React and Typescript.

## Running Locally

Open a new terminal in this subfolder of the repostiory and run

```sh
npm install

npm run dev
```

Then navigate to the URL in your terminal.

## Connecting The Back End

Once you have build and deployed the [back end code](../backend/README.md) to AWS Lambda and created a function URL, copy this url to your [App.tsx component](./src/App.tsx#L24)

```
    // NOTE: replace this url with the url of your lambda function once deployed:
    const response = await fetch('https://xxxxxxxx.lambda-url.eu-west-2.on.aws/', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ messages: newMessages })
    });
```
